## Comprehensive Analysis

### 1. Sales Overview and Performance Trends
- KPIs Identified: Total revenue, total units sold, total unique orders, and average order value.  
- Monthly Trends: Monthly revenue and unit sales reveal demand peaks and seasonal variations.  
- Insight: Consistent growth in revenue during certain months suggests seasonal promotions or events drive higher sales.  

### 2. Product and Category Analysis
- Top Categories: Identified by revenue and units sold (`top_categories_by_sales.csv`, `top_categories_by_units.csv`).  
- Size/Variant Preferences: Customers showed demand for specific sizes and product variants (`size_summary.csv`).  
- Insight: Some categories contribute disproportionately to revenue, while others sell in volume at low margins.  

### 3. Fulfilment and Status Analysis
- Fulfilment: Orders and revenue compared across fulfilment channels (`fulfilment_summary.csv`).  
- Status: Delivered, Cancelled, and Returned orders analysed (`status_summary.csv`).  
- Insight: Fulfilment by Amazon may dominate sales, but cancellations and returns highlight areas for operational improvement.  

### 4. Customer and Geographical Analysis
- Regional Distribution: Sales mapped by state and city (`state_sales_summary.csv`, `city_sales_summary.csv`).  
- Insight: Revenue is concentrated in a few top-performing states/cities. Regional differences suggest the need for localized strategies.  

---

## Insights on Customer Behaviour
- Product Preferences: High demand for a few top categories and variants.  
- Behavioural Trends: High cancellation and return rates in some categories may be linked to quality or fulfilment issues.  
- Regional Behaviour: Strong markets exist in top 5 cities/states, while weaker regions present opportunities for expansion.

## Recommendations

1. Sales Strategy Improvements  
   - Focus campaigns on top-performing categories.  
   - Re-price or bundle low-margin, high-volume products to increase profitability.  

2. Inventory Management  
   - Align stock levels with geographical demand.  
   - Address high-return categories by improving product information and quality control.  

3. Customer Service Enhancements  
   - Reduce cancellations by improving fulfilment accuracy and delivery times.  
   - Enhance return handling and customer communication to maintain trust.
